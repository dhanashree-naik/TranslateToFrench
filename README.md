## Translate 1 to 1000 numbers to French
In the French language, Arabic numerals that we use in everyday can be spelled out just like they can in English. For example, the numeral 175 is written as one hundred seventy five in English and cent soixante quinze in French
French is interesting becuase they have a mixture of a decimal (base 10) and vegesimal (base 20) system, created by committee to placate two different regions of Franch that used different systems.

To summarize:
• Between 70–79 and 90–99, French numbers use a vegesimal base sys-tem. For everything else, it is base 10.
• Numbers ending in 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, and 71 have an “and”. For example, 21 is vingt et un (“twenty and one”)
• Numbers larger than 100 are written as x hundred. For example, 600 becomes six cent (“six hundred”).
• To make things simpler, we’ll say that 80 is quatre vingt (without an “s”) and 200 is deux cent (also without an “s”). We also do no want hyphens between number parts (so 17 becomes dix sept and not dix-sept).
